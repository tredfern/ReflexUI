* Animated sprites for backgrounds and images
	- If sprite is animated, need to configure animation. Maybe this is a specific animation type???
* Option list control	- For things like dropdowns, but to start maybe just the ability to cycle through options
* Slider control	- needed to set up Options screen demo
* Progressbar component		- For game screen demo
* Scrollable controls for text etc...
	- This means components that figure out what elements to render. Easiest might be components that support surfaces...
* Form based components
	- Adding components that make it easy to collect the information from forms/UIs
* Textbox component - Support simple editing of text. Single line is fine
