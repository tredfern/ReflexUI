* Animated sprites for backgrounds and images
	- If sprite is animated, need to configure animation. Maybe this is a specific animation type???
* Option list control	- For things like dropdowns, but to start maybe just the ability to cycle through options
* Slider control	- needed to set up Options screen demo
* Scrollable controls for text etc...
	- This means components that figure out what elements to render. Easiest might be components that support surfaces...
* Form based components
	- Adding components that make it easy to collect the information from forms/UIs
* Textbox component - Support simple editing of text. Single line is fine
* Use visible property to track whether to draw the component or not, also effects layout
* Tooltip component for easily laying out UIs that flow with the mouse or other controls
* Implement helper for validating that component is in the proper state to perform it's work. Progressbar for example needs numbers
	to do math to draw. It should just not draw if it's values are not configured properly instead of killing the program.

BUGS:
- Why does the first menu in the demo not release the "focus" animation?


IMPROVE:
- Default values for binding is a bit of a hack. Binding a property should get that property. 
- What is the proper expectation when values are not set properly on a component? Probably not to crash ->
	but how should it deal with informing the user?
- Really define the API in the long run to be cleaner and tighter (with less stuff thrown around)

- Did I finish the registerStepEvent stuff? CAUSE IT DON"T LOOK LIKE IT!
